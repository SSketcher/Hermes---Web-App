    <p><b>HERMES</b> is a fitness band, worn on a person's wrist and is designed to track physical activity. Fitbit devices are designed to track important health and activity markers, including heart rate, quality of sleep and the number of steps walked.</p>
    <p>Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious. You may also feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.</p>
    <p>Sleep makes you feel better, but its importance goes way beyond just boosting your mood or banishing under-eye circles. Adequate sleep is a key part of a healthy lifestyle, and can benefit your heart, weight, mind, and more.</p>
    <p>Mindfulness is the practice of purposely focusing your attention on the present momentâ€”and accepting it without judgment. Mindfulness is now being examined scientifically and has been found to be a key element in stress reduction and overall happiness.</p>
